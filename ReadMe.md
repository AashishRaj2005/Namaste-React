# Markdown tips

### Notes on Markdown:
- **Headings**: Use `#` for main headings (`# Project Title`) and `##` for subheadings (`## Table of Contents`).
- **Lists**: Use `-` or `*` for bullet points.
- **Code Blocks**: Enclose code examples in triple backticks (```), followed by the language identifier (`bash`, `javascript`, etc.), for syntax highlighting.
- **Links**: `[Link Text](URL)` format is used for creating clickable links.

Feel free to further customize the template with additional sections or formatting as needed for your project.
